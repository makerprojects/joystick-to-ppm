# joystick-to-ppm

This is a port of Flytron's Compufly to Java for cross platform use. There have also been enhancements made to the original to support multiple usb sources. The goal is to make a versatile computer based system to control RC Land, Sea, Aircraft and other projects. Use the software with the PiKoder/USB (interface from USB2PPM, please refer to http://www.pikoder.com/PiKoder_USB_EN.html for more information) hardware solution to get PPM to a RC transmitter. The Current version is set up for Windows with a batch file to launch. We are working on getting that into a universal .jar

Should work with v1 and v2 but please note that this software is only tested in combination with the PiKoder/USB.


To get started:

Run start.x86.bat for x86

Run start.x64.bat for x64

Requirements:

PiKoder USB2PPM: http://www.pikoder.com/PiKoder_USB_EN.html
